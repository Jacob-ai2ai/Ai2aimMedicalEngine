# Aeterna OS v2.1: Operational Walkthrough

Welcome to the Aeterna OS v2.1 walkthrough. This guide demonstrates the key features and operational workflows of the modernized AI2AIM RX platform, highlighting the functional parity achieved with legacy requirements.

## 1. The Bridge (Dashboard)

The Bridge is your tactical control deck. It provides high-density clinical telemetry and AI-driven insights.

- **System IQ**: Located in the PulseHeader, this reflects the overall health and "intelligence" of the autonomous system.
- **Neural Analytics Hub**: Access the 8 specialized hubs (Inventory, Financial, Specialists, etc.) from the central dashboard or the sidebar.
- **Cognitive Feed**: A real-time narrative of AI decisions and system events.

- *Toggle*: Use the icon in the top-right header to hot-swap skins.

## 3. Workflow Simulator

Aeterna OS includes a safe-testing environment for clinical automation.

- **Neural Audit Trail**: Watch the "Brain" evaluate staffing, equipment, and safety standards in real-time.
- **Safety Overrides**: Test Vanguard's ability to trigger accreditation-safe blocks before they happen in a live clinic.
- **Cognitive Feed Integration**: Every simulation step is live-narrated for clinic lead review.

## 4. Specialist & Affiliate Hub

Manage your medical network with ease.

- **Central Registry**: Track physicians, nurses, and external affiliates.
- **Neural Ratings**: Assess specialist performance based on referral quality and outcome telemetry.
- **Credentialing**: Monitor specialist certifications and expiry dates (Aeterna auto-detects risks).

## 5. Inventory Matrix

Real-time tracking of medications and medical supplies.

- **Stock Levels**: Visual indicators for stable, warning, and critical stock.
- **Machinery Link**: Direct integration with dispensing hardware via the Robot API.
- **Automated Procurement**: Aeterna suggests and executes purchase orders when stock hits critical thresholds.

## 6. Financial Matrix & Revenue Pulse

Operational financial telemetry for clinic management.

- **Revenue Pulse**: Real-time daily revenue tracking.
- **AR Aging**: Deep visibility into Accounts Receivable (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91+ days).
- **Clinical Blockers**: Identify encounters that are unbilled or require documentation before invoicing.

## 7. Diagnostic IQ

Autonomous system-wide data integrity auditing.

- **Integrity Gaps**: Detects missing patient encounters, orphaned prescriptions, and malformed metadata.
- **Neural Fixer**: One-click autonomous deduplication and data repair protocols.

## 8. Workflow Runtime

The event-driven engine behind Aeterna's autonomy.

- **WorkflowArchitect**: Visualize and modify autonomous medical rituals using the 3D node-graph.
- **Simulation Mode**: Run "dry-runs" of new workflows to audit safety and efficacy before live deployment.
- **Active Threads**: Monitor concurrent autonomous operations in the PulseHeader.

## 9. Command Palette (CMD+K)

The fastest way to navigate. Jump to any patient, prescription, or operational node instantly.

## 10. Sleep Clinic Level 3 Operations

Aeterna OS provides specialized support for portable diagnostic monitoring.

- **Level 3 Monitor Dispatch**: Automated coordination for home sleep tests.
- **Diagnostic-IQ Sync**: Real-time integrity checks for sleep study metadata.
- **Specialist Review**: Nexus-physician collaboration for high-priority results.

## 11. Accreditation AI

Autonomous monitoring to ensure your clinic is always "Audit Ready".

- **Alberta Health Standard Scan**: Real-time compliance checks against local regulations.
- **Automatic Audit Trails**: Narrativized logs of every clinical decision and intervention.
- **Credential Guardian**: Preventive alerts for specialist certification expiry.
